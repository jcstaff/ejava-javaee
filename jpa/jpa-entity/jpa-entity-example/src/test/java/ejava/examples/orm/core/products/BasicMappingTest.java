     * we create the database and the names of the Java class are sufficient
     * for use in the database table. 
     * 
     * Note that there could be only one Entity named Bike. Therefore, the
     * descriptor named the entity MappedBike and then supplied a table name
     * that was also being used for the annotated Bike.
     * 
     * By looking at the Bike class and mapping file, we would expect to see a 
     * Bike table with columns id, make, model, and size. The data types for 
     * these columns are the defaults of the Java Persistence provider. If we
     * left the name off, the table would have been called MappedBike.
