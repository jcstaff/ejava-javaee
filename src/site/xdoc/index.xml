      <ul>

      <!--
      <li><ul> <!- week 13: Async ->
          <li>Setup and deploy your JMS publisher code to eSales. All
          resources should be injected by the container.</li>
          <li>Setup and implement a JMS MDB in the eBidbot to receive 
          updates published by eSales.</li>
          <li>Setup and deploy your JMS publisher code to eBidbotEJB.
          Again - all resources should be injected by the container.</li>
          <li>Verify that the eSales JMS JSE Subscriber from last
          week receives published messages from eSalesEJB.</li>
          <li>Implement an EJBTimer to perform scheduled work within
          eSalesEJB and eBidbotEJB.</li>
          <li>Test, cleanup, document, and turn in project 3</li> 
      </ul></li>

      <li><ul> <!- week 12: JMS ->
          <li>Security
              <ul>
                  <li>Finish security configuration, implementation, and testing</li>
              </ul>
          </li>

          <li>JMS Message Design
              <ul>
                  <li>Design your JMS message type(s)</li>

                  <li>Write a utility class that publishes the messages.
                  This class ideally would be placed in with the BLImpl
                  classes.  However, if it publishes DTO classes, the
                  DTOs may have to get moved in with the BO module to
                  satisfy dependency constraints.</li>

                  <li>Write an integration-test for the publishing and 
                  subscribing of the message types designed above. The
                  integration-test should use the topic(s) pre-configured
                  in the class server.</li>
              </ul>
          </li>

          <li>JSE JMS Client
              <ul>
                  <li>Implement a Java SE Client to receive and log the JMS
                  messages. This client can be placed in BLImpl, must use a
                  selector, and be launchable by the grader using an Ant script.
                  The Ant script can be part of either the BLImpl or RMI Test
                  project. See class examples on how write the Ant script.</li>
              </ul>
          </li>
      </ul></li>

      <li><ul> <!- week 11: Security ->
            <li>Project
                <ul>
                  <li>Complete your project 2, finish testing, and turn in.</li>
                  <li>Start project 3</li>
                </ul>

          <li>EJB
              <ul>
                  <li>Assign EJB to security-domain "other".
                  The RMI Tests should fail access at this point.</li>
                  <li>Specify required roles to access each EJB method</li>
              </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Application Server
              <ul>
                  <li>Make sure your application server has the necessary users and 
                  roles. (This was made available in the class example repository in week 01)</li>
              </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Integration Tests
              <ul>
                  <li>Add the necessary logins to your existing integration tests
                  to allow them to pass again.</li>
                  <li>Author at least one new test to demonstrate you have security
                  enabled</li>
              </ul>

          <li>WAR
              <ul>
                  <li>Assign WAR to security-domain "other"</li>
                  <li>Add security-constraint elements to the WAR web.xml. The 
                  user should be prompted for a login at this point and be able to
                  access web pages and EJB methods that they are authorized for
                  and be refused access to what they are un-authorized to access</li>
                  <li>Eliminate access to any information or option the user does
                  not have access to see or use</li>
              </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Overall
              <ul>
                  <li>Eliminate the passing of userId information when the appropriate
                  means is to obtain through the EJB or WARs security context.</li>
              </ul>
          </li>
            <li>Exercises
                <ul>
                  <li>Complete through Part I</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
      </ul></li>

      <li><ul> <!- week 10: Web ->
            <li>Examples
                <ul>
                  <li>Look over Web UI parts of the ejbsessionBank.</li>
                  <li>The webejb example shows an example of RMI and JAX-RS
                      being used as a remote facade. You may use either technique 
                      for eBidbot. eSales should use RMI.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Project
                <ul>
                  <li>Add a WAR project to eSales. Add in the controller,
                      handler, and supporting JSP implementations.</li>
                  <li>Add a WAR project to eBidbot and deploy your eBidbot
                      EJBs within that WAR - either embedded or included from a 
                      separate module. See the webejb example</li>
                  <li>Add in the controller, handler, and supporting
                      JSP implementations for eBidbot.  This WAR may obtain
                      functionality implemented by eSalesEJB. However, it should not
                      directly communicate with eSalesEJB. eBidbotEJB should act as a
                      facade for all behavior performed on behalf of eBidbotWAR</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Exercises
                <ul>
                  <li>Complete through Part G</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
      </ul></li>
      <li><ul> <!- week 09: Transactions ->
          <li>Begin adding the other session beans, remote interfaces,
          business logic integration, and RMI tests for project 2.</li>
          <li>Finish implementing EJB use cases for DMV end-to-end testing.</li>
          <li>Add @Transaction declarations</li>
          <li>Implement the transaction test requirement. You may
          want to place logic for the transaction test within 
          the TestUtilEJB if you end up with undesirable business
          logic in order to demonstrate the rollback of a transaction.
          Remember, your entities must actually hit the DB and be rolled
          back as part of the transaction. Simply rejecting bad data does
          not satisfy the project transaction rollback demo requirement.</li>
          <li>Note that Mayberry will use JAX-RS and JAXB for its remote
          facade (not RMI). We will cover that next week.</li>
      </ul></li>

      <li><ul> <!- week 08: JNDI and CDI ->
            <li>Project
                <ul>
                  <li>Look over the specification for project 2.</li>
                  <li>Apply the maven, EJB, EAR, RMI Test, and remote interface
                  concepts from the exercises to your project 2.</li>
                  <li>Design your remote interfaces and DTO classes for the DMV</li>
                  <li>Have one end-to-end thread through eDmvTest, EJB, and project 1
                  operational</li>
                </ul>

            <li>Examples
                <ul>
                  <li>The class examples have been updated to include the 
                  server-side modules. Be be sure to have your jboss server 
                  running when building prior to building them from this 
                  point forward.</li>
                  <li>Begin looking at ejbsessionBank example application; 
                  which forms an EJB, EAR, RMI Test, as well as a WAR Client.
                  These will be key component types within project 2.</li>

                  Be sure to include proper deletion as a part of your cleanup

                  <li>Create the remainder of your business objects for the project.</li>
                  <li>Declare the business objects as @Entities and map the classes
                  to tables and columns in your database. Your schema file(s) and JPA
                  DAOs should be using the same database tables at this point.
                  Mark relationships and problem fields as @Transient at this point 
                  in time.</li>
                  <li>Create unit tests for any non-trivial business rules implemented
                  within the business object classes.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>JPA DAOs
                <ul>
                  <li>Create unit tests for the ability to create your business objects
                  and get them by primary key.
                  Pay attention to the business rules your application has for ordering
                  the creation (e.g., must have Auction before having Bid).
                  Solve dependency issues with sensible pre-conditions for child objects.</li>
                </ul>

            <li>Business Logic
                <ul>
                  <li>Create unit test for injest and begin implementation of injest
                  for at least one of the types in your model and provided test data.
                  Try to avoid using classes with required relationships at this point.

      <li><ul> <!-- week 03: DAOs and EntityManager -->
            <li>Examples
            <ul>
              <li>Go through the EntityManager Exercise</li>          
              <li>Look over the class project example implementation under the 
                projects/eMarket/eSales directory as it relates to integrating
                JPA within the individual modules.
              </li>
            </ul>
            </li>

            <li>Database Schema
                <ul>
                  <li>Design a draft DB schema for your business object. This should go in 
                    the module hosting your DAOs.</li>
                  <li>Implement a way to create your schema in the DB as a part of your DAO testing.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>Maven and DAO Unit Test Framework
                <ul>
                  <li>Add JPA/Hibernate infrastructure to your project DAO/Impl module.
                    This should at least consist of a successful connection to
                    the DB.  You are done with this goal when you have a
                    JPA JUnit test for the DAO and the setUp() method is able to
                    create an EntityManager.
                  </li>
                </ul>
            </li>          
          
            <li>JPA Entities and DAOs
            <ul>
              <li>Enhance your business object (BO) definition with @Entity
                declarations, a non-private default constructor, and a primary
                key designation (@Id) to make them legal entities. Leave
                other things default for now. Annotate all collections with
                @Transient annotation. We are not ready to cover relationships
                just yet.
              </li>
              <li>Design DAO interfaces to support the data access requirements
                  of your business logic participating in the end-to-end 
                  scenario. These interfaces should be void of persistence
                  technology detail - but feel free to commit to JPA for the 
                  semantics of how the calls should work.
              </li>
              <li>Implement an initial JPA implementation for your DAO
                   interfaces. Keep in mind the scope of the end-to-end 
                   scenario when building these methods to help limit and
                   focus the work performed.
              </li>
            </ul>
            </li>

            <li>DAO Testing
            <ul>
              <li>Design and implement a set of unit tests for a few of your JPA
                DAO(s). Note how the default schema for the @Entities may not
                match up with your desired DB schema at this point when you run
                the tests.

      <li><ul> <!-- week 02: DevEnv and Business Logic -->
          <li>Look over the class project 1 and post any questions.</li>

          <li>Establish your project directory structure and perform a build from the root.</li>
          <li>Create the business logic interfaces and define the operations that will
              satisfy the end-to-end scenario. Create skeletal business object classes
              necessary to express the business logic interfaces.</li>
          <li>Create a JUnit unit test for the business logic to address the requirements 
              for the end-to-end scenario.  Place this unit test in with the module
              containing your business logic 
              and use it to help scope your future work on the project.</li>
          <li>Create a set of business logic classes to implement the busines logic
              interfaces. Stub out each call for now so the end-to-end test will
              execute.</li>

          <li>Design and implement the details of at least one business object 
              used in the business logic interface above.</li>
          <li>Design and implement a JUnit unit test for that business object. Place
              this unit test within the module containing your business object.</li>

          <li>Send me a copy of your project, in a stable, known state,
          sometime this week; ideally by early Monday evening. You should have
          a project structure in place that can build from the root, a good 
          start on the items mentioned above, and a list of issues or questions
          that you would like answered about how to move forward.
          This will be used as feedback to the class.</li>
